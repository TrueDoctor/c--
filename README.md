# C--

The aim of this project is to develop an easy way to write brainfuck code by transpiling it from an intermediate language. The project is split into two parts, an interactive brainfuck interpreter with debug capabilities and the transpiler to generate the actual code.

for further information please consult the [Wiki](https://github.com/TrueDoctor/c--/wiki/Home) until we rework this placeholder.
